DOM:- Document Object Model.
The DOM (Document Object Model) in HTML is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. It allows programming languages like JavaScript to interact with, modify, and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page.

In simple terms:
HTML defines the structure of a web page.

The DOM represents that structure as a tree of nodes (elements, text, attributes, etc.).

JavaScript can use the DOM to dynamically change the content or style of the page without reloading.
